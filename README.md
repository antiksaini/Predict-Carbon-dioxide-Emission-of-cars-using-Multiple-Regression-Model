Using scikit-learn to implement Multiple linear regression.

Multiple Regression Model
In reality, there are multiple variables that predict the Co2emission. 
When more than one independent variable is present, the process is called multiple linear regression.
For example, predicting co2emission using FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB, EngineSize and Cylinders of cars. The good thing here is that Multiple linear regression is the extension of simple linear regression model.


Explained variance regression score:
If  𝑦̂   is the estimated target output, y the corresponding (correct) target output, and Var is Variance, the square of the standard deviation, then the explained variance is estimated as follow:

>> E𝚡𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚍 V𝚊𝚛𝚒𝚊𝚗𝚌𝚎( 𝑦 , 𝑦̂ ) = 1 − 𝑉𝑎𝑟{ 𝑦 − 𝑦̂ } 𝑉𝑎𝑟{𝑦} 

The best possible score is 1.0, lower values are worse.
